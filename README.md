Touch screen terminal (kiosk) embedded application for movie ticket selling. Semester project.

Made with WPF which is touchscreen ready out of the box. Custom controls with simple design and large hitzones implemented.

Data is stored in an Microsoft SQL Server database. 

MVVM pattern intended but it's MVC in fact because I store links to `View` to implicitly call it from `ViewModel`.

# Things I was proud of when I just finished the project

* Seat selection screen
  * It utilizes `Viewbox` and it's ability to scale inner controls (to fit cinema rooms of different sizes)
  * It generates controls dynamically
  * Every seat control is a styled checkbox
* Project structure
* Quick start wizard (because my teacher didn't manage to set up database and compile the project)

### Kiosk app

As always I have put a lot of effort into UI and UX and hope it was worth it. It launches windowed only in debug mode.
